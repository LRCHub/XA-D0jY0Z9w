I belong in nowhere, solitary
I can see it ever fleeting
A knot in my heart
and it disappears
A note in for quiet
and days of ease
Everyone has a domain
allowing no one
Accuracy inside, yearned
to find
I thought I had been
understandin' it,
It's buried in noise
and withering
Love the life you live, live the
life you love
Love the life you live, live the
life you love
All of you have to take
And everybody else may
seem a lil' downward
All of you have to take
Soon, you will see
All of you have to take
And everybody's time may
seem a lil' downward
All of you have to take
Oh, you will see
Answers seeked,
the conflict,soar
Own Way progress,
a long seen world
High end essential I touch,
redeem soul
Through all the silence,
a brand new wind blows
It's just like every shape
is shown…
I'm watchin' every shape
you've shown…
It's just like every shape
is shown…
shape is shown…
Sentiments in purity, had it
when young
What are we to find…
Noise confines
It's sounding within, and it
resonates, you
Always have known it
either way
Love the life you live, live the
life you love
Love the life you live, live the
life you love
All of you have to take
And everybody else may seem a
lil' downward
All of you have to take
Soon, you will see
All of you have to take
And everybody's time may seem a
lil' downward
All of you have to take
Oh, you will see
Answers seeked,
the conflict,soar
Own Way progress,
a long seen world
High end essential I touch,
redeem soul
This way forward,
and now I see hope
Conflicts soared, the answer
will show
Right Way progress,
my feet to make sure
Voice like eternity rings
within notes
Route is a definite,
now the wind blows
