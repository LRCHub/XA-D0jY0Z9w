I wanna be a real full woman
Yeah and live
Like a real full woman
Every day
And I wanna make love like a real full woman
Every day
Yeah I said I wanna make love like a real full woman
Don't stop me talking 'bout love
How'm I gonna find what I'm dreaming of
Don't stop me talking 'bout love
I got to find what I'm dreaming of
Always gotta be the lioness
Taking care of everybody else
A woman like me needs love
A woman like me needs a man to be
Stronger than herself
Don't stop me talking 'bout love
How'm I gonna find what I'm dreaming of
Don't stop me talking 'bout love
I got to find what I'm dreaming of
A sweet man to cling to
And whisper sweet things to
Cause a full woman must do
What a full woman must do
How about I be me
And you be you
And you be you
How about I be me
And you be you
How about I be me
Don't stop me talking 'bout love
How'm I gonna find what I'm dreaming of
Don't stop me talking 'bout love
I got to find what I'm dreaming of
